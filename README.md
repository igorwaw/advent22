# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code is a serious of programming puzzles: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about
Here is my take on the 2022 edition. 

Feel free to use for inspiration. For some tasks I implemented more than was
required because I felt like it, for others I went straight to the point.

## Technology used

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-%3E%3D3.10-blue) 
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-C99-green) 
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-C++11-green)

Task 6 and 8 solved with C. I used C99 standard (mostly for inititialization in loops and //comments),
also compiles as newer amended versions C11 and C17. Tested with GCC 8.5.0 and 12.2.0, but should work with any C compiler. 

Task 12 solved with C++. I used C++11 standard. It also compiles as amended/experimental newer versions (14, 17 and 2a).

Task 2 requires Python 3.10 or higher because I used "match" statement. Task 11: Python 3.9 or higher (math.lcm).
All other programs should work with older versions of Python3 as well.

Extra Python libraries:
* treelib for task 7
* pygame for task 9 (visualization)
* tqdm for task 11 (progress bar)

## Sources

I added some improvements based on https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/ - but only after doing my own version first. Check out the Python Journey for some cool tricks.
